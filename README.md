This repository contains userscripts I wrote to simplify/bypass some annoying things I encounter on the web.

The general usefulness of some of these scripts is close to nil as they deal with my very specific annoyances,
but anyone's welcome to use and tweak them for their own purposes if they see fit.

The scripts are tested exclusively on [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io). Most other userscript managers (with the exception of Greasemonkey) *should* be compatible with this script, but no promises are made. 

The scripts are listed [here](./scripts). To install any of them, click the "Raw" button while on a browser that has a userscript manager installed.
