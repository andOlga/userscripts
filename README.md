This repository contains userscripts I wrote to simplify/bypass some annoying things I encounter on the web.

The general usefulness of some of these scripts is close to nil as they deal with my very specific annoyances,
but anyone's welcome to use and tweak them for their own purposes if they see fit.

The scripts are tested exclusively on [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io). Other userscript managers *should* be compatible with them, but no promises are made. 

The scripts are listed [here](./scripts). To install any of them, click the "Raw" button while on a browser that has a userscript manager installed.

Please do not submit any pull requests to this repository, they will be automatically closed. This is not meant as a place for *other* people to put their scripts into, make your own repo for that.
